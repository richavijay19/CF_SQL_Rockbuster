This repository contains codes for SQL queries for my SQL project - Rockbuster Stealth Data Analysis Project.
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime,the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive. As a data analyst for Rockbuster Stealth’s business intelligence (BI) department, I am helping with the launch strategy for the new online video service.The BI department helps other departments, from inventory to customer insights, with data-related queries.Here to start with, I first loaded all of Rockbuster’s data into a relational database management system (RDBMS) and then used SQL for data analysis and answering any ad hoc business questions that may come from other departments.
