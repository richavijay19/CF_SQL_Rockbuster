This repository contains codes for SQL queries for my SQL project - Rockbuster Stealth Data Analysis Project.

Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime,the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive. As a data analyst for Rockbuster Stealth’s business intelligence (BI) department, I am helping with the launch strategy for the new online video service.The BI department helps other departments, from inventory to customer insights, with data-related queries.Here to start with, I first loaded all of Rockbuster’s data into a relational database management system (RDBMS) and then used SQL for data analysis and answering any ad hoc business questions that may come from other departments.

The goal of the project is to acquire a good understanding of the various data points. This has been achieved by exploring the inventory and revenues of the stores by using the relational database management system pgAdmin4 within the PostgreSQL. The findings have been communicated and visualized in Tableau and PowerPoint.


During this project I learned the SQL from the very beginning.Once the project started , it was important to know the relationship that exists in the Rockbuster database and overview of all the tables and to execute this, I extracted The snowflake-type entity relationship diagram  with DbVisualizer. The list of all the fact and dimension tables along with data types, keys, and column descriptions were collected in the data dictionary.

Thereafter started preparing the data using simple queries like ordering, grouping , filtering followed by data cleaning and data consistency checks ( looking for missing values, duplicate records).fter that wrote few queries for calculating descriptive statistics of the data.

Finally by writing queries, subqueries combined with joints , CTEs , I was able to find  answers for more advanced questions.
