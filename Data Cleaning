Finding duplicate records : Here we are going to run queries to check for duplicate records.
Film Table
Query :
SELECT film_id,title,
release_year,language_id,
rental_rate,rating,
replacement_cost,
count(*)
FROM film
GROUP BY film_id,title,
release_year,language_id,
rental_rate,rating,
replacement_cost
HAVING COUNT(*)>1



Non-Uniform Data : We can perform the check for inconsistencies in data by using the GROUP
BY or DISTINCT Keywords
Film_table
SELECT * FROM film
This query returned 1000 rows in the table

Using GROUPBY
SELECT film_id,title,language_id,rating
FROM film
GROUP BY film_id,title,language_id,rating
This query returned 1000 rows in the table
Using DISTINCT
SELECT DISTINCT film_id,title,language_id,rating
FROM film
This query returned 1000 distinct rows in the table.
